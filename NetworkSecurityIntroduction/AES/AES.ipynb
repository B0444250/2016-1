It is entirely possible that in the near future this new ransomware variant will be launched into the wild just as dangerous as any other mature ransomware, but with the time required for upgrades and modifications significantly shortened due to the relatively easiness of coding in Python. Moreover, since it’s written in Python and compiled with PyInstaller, authors can easily change it to support other platforms, such as Linux and MacOS."
